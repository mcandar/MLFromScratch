# MLFromScratch

**MLFromScratch is a project composed of a series of documents to help deeper understanding machine learning methods.** Thus, there are a number of methods **implemented from scratch as tutorials**. These tutorials include:

* Background theory and math
* Python code
* Visualization
* Interpretation

in the form of jupyter notebooks. Although each document has a mild introduction, *this project expects a brief math, statistics and linear algebra background.*

## Before Getting Started



### Installation

```git clone```

### Requirements

- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

This project aims to go particularly deeper into various methods used in AI. More specifically in machine and deep learning, statistics and probability we try to do more the just scratching the surface. With this in mind, the notebooks written in this project composed of four main components:

1. Introduction and math behind it.
2. Python code from scratch with explanations, human readable.
3. Visualization of results, and the procedure.
4. Conclusion and interpretation.

This project assumes each one who come here and check notebooks has a rough plan and roadmap of how to learn machine learning and where to start.

### What it is

By reading the notebooks one can:

- See the background theory.
- Catch the details of steps in the code (which could be hard to find on the web).
- Interpret the results with graphs.

### What it is not

- Ready to use (plug-and-play) function calls - *We write from scratch.*
- Task-focused problem-solving data analysis - *Only focus is to understand the model with its theory.*
- Object oriented and efficient code - *We code to keep up with mathematical notation.*
